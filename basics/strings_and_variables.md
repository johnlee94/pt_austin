### Strings and Variables!

### Variables

Variables are used to store a value to a keyword.

In Javascript, we have special words such as var, const, and let!


```
var name = "Austin"

let favorite_animal = "mouse"

const DOB = "July 9, 1994"
```

What happens when we:

```
console.log(name)
```


<br>
<br>

Variable names should be something that makes sense to its corresponding value.

For instance, we might have a variable that stores the a grocery shopping list.

```
grocery_list = ["eggs", "milk", "rice", "kimchi", "bread"]
```

The value of the variable grocery_list is an array. We will go over what an array is
later!

Variables cannot have numbers in front of them "1my_variable" and cannot have
any spaces.

What happens if we try to do...
```
var first name = "Sam"
```

Returns an error! Javascript thinks that the variable name is simply the word
