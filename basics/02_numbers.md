# Numbers..!

Numbers are another basic Javascript data type.

They are exactly what they sound like.. They are numbers like 1, -50, or 50.05.

```
let myInteger = 5;
let myDecimal = 5.05;
```

Note that in JS, numbers encompass ALL numbers (integers, decimals, negatives, etc)

In other languages such as Python or Java, numbers are split into two different data types
Integers and Floats (Decimal Numbers).
