# Numbers..!

Numbers are another basic Javascript data type.

They are exactly what they sound like.. They are numbers like 1, -50, or 50.05.

```
let myInteger = 5;
let myDecimal = 5.05;
```

Note that in JS, numbers encompass ALL numbers (integers, decimals, negatives, etc)

In other languages such as Python or Java, numbers are split into two different data types
Integers and Floats (Decimal Numbers).

### Basic Arithmetic Operations

We can perform many mathematical operations to our Javascript Numbers data type.

We have addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents...

Quickly in your console try some basic operations and see what you get!

```
//addition
5 + 5

//subtraction
25.5 - 10

//multiplcation
4*4

//division
25/5

//exponent
5**2
```

In addition, we have other Javascript operators such as the commonly used
"modulus" operator ( % ) to check the remainder of two numbers.

For instance:
```
5%2
```

This operation above returns 1 because 5 divided by two leaves a REMAINDER of 1.

We can do some cool things with the modulus operator, such as checking to see if a number is
even or odd.
```
//40 is an even number.
40%2
//This returns 0, because 2 goes into 40 evenly.
```
