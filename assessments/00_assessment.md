### Let's Review! :D

It's been a while since we had our tutoring sessions, and as I can imagine, it's probably been a while since you've done Javascript!

Let's go over the concepts we have learned thus far!

# STRINGS


Make a function that returns the number of characters in a given string.

```
myStringLength("How many?") // => 9
```

Make a function that returns how many times vowel characters appear in a given string.

```
howManyVowels("Hello") // => 2
```

Write a function that converts a given array of words into a sentence. Note the rules of creating a "proper" sentence (Capitalize first word, provide spaces between each word, and finally adding a period at the end)

```
makeSentence(["the", "dog", "walked", "down", "the", "street"]) // => "The dog walked down the street."
```

# NUMBERS

Make a function that converts human years to "dog years". Note that humans live much longer than dogs. To convert a human's age to a dog's, you add one and divide by 7.

```
dogYears(6) // => 1
```


Make a function that calculates how much money I am spending that month. An array of different expenses (numbers) will be passed to this function. A total sum of all the expenses should be returned.

```
allExpenses([500, 1000, 50, 25]) //=> 1575
```

Make a function that takes in two parameters an array of given numbers and a specific number, and returns a new array of numbers that contains only numbers that are greater than the given number.

```
greaterThan([500, 501, 502, 450, 700, 300], 500) // => [501, 502, 700]
```

Make a function that takes in two parameters: an array of numbers and a string value of either "ascending" or "descending", that returns an array of the given numbers, but in sequential order.

```
sortNumbers([4,2,7,6], "ascending") //=> [2,4,6,7]
sortNumbers([4,2,7,6], "descending") //=> [7,6,4,2]
```

Make a function that takes in two parameters, an array of numbers and a specific number, and returns the number in the array that is closest to the given number.

```
nearestNumber([5, 6, 7, 8], 9) // => 8
```

# CONTROL FLOW

Make a function that takes in two parameters: an array and a number. If the number of elements in the array is less than the given number, return true. Else return false.

```
greaterLengthOfArray([1, "hello", 5, [4, 5], 7], 10) //=> true
```



# ARRAYS

Make a function that takes in an array of any given numbers, and returns a new array of the given numbers, but that contains only unique values.

```
uniqueNumbers([1,1,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]) // => [1,3,4,5,6,7,8]
```

# LOOPS
